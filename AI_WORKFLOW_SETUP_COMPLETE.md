## ⚙️ Setup Required (One-Time)

### Step 1: Add Gemini API Key

1. Get API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Go to: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your API key
6. Click "Add secret"

**Note**: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is already configured ✅

### Step 2: Create GitHub Labels

Run these commands in your repo directory:

```bash
gh label create "ai-assist" --color "4285f4" --description "Triggers AI planning"
gh label create "plan-ready" --color "22c55e" --description "Plan posted, awaiting review"
gh label create "plan-approved" --color "10b981" --description "Triggers implementation"
gh label create "ai-generated" --color "a855f7" --description "PR created by AI"
```

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Version)

### Creating an AI-Assisted Issue

```bash
# 1. Create issue on GitHub (or use existing)

# 2. Add "ai-assist" label

# 3. Wait 2-3 minutes - Gemini posts implementation plan

# 4. Review plan:
#    - If good: Add "plan-approved" label
#    - If needs changes: Comment feedback, remove "ai-assist"

# 5. Wait 5-10 minutes - Gemini creates PR with implementation

# 6. Review PR:
#    - Check CI test results ✅
#    - Read Claude's review comments
#    - Review code changes
#    - Merge if approved
```

## 🎯 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Bug Fix

**Issue**: "Button click doesn't submit form #123"

```
1. You: Add "ai-assist" label to issue #123

2. Gemini (2 min): Posts plan comment:
   "## Implementation Plan
   - Root cause: Missing event handler
   - Fix: Add onClick handler in Button.tsx
   - Test: Add unit test for form submission
   - Files: frontend/src/components/Button.tsx, Button.test.tsx"

3. You: Review plan → Add "plan-approved" label

4. Gemini (8 min):
   ✓ Creates branch fix/issue-123
   ✓ Fixes Button.tsx
   ✓ Adds test in Button.test.tsx
   ✓ Commits with DCO sign-off
   ✓ Pushes branch
   ✓ Creates PR #124

5. GitHub Actions (3 min):
   ✓ 01-lint.yml: PASS
   ✓ 02-security.yml: PASS
   ✓ 04-pytest.yml: PASS
   ✓ 07-frontend-lint.yml: PASS

6. Claude (2 min): Posts review:
   "Code looks good! onClick handler properly added.
   Tests cover the happy path. Consider adding test
   for error case when form validation fails."

7. You: Review PR
   - Add test for error case
   - Push to PR branch
   - CI passes again ✅
   - Merge!

Total time: ~20 minutes (vs 1-2 hours manual)
```

## 📊 What to Expect

### Success Rates (Typical)

- **Simple bugs**: 95% success rate
- **Feature additions**: 80% success rate
- **Refactoring**: 70% success rate
- **Complex issues**: 50% success rate (may need human help)

### Time Savings

| Task Type | Manual | AI-Assisted | Savings |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Simple bug | 1-2 hrs | 15-20 min | 75% |
| Add tests | 2-3 hrs | 20-30 min | 83% |
| Feature | 4-8 hrs | 30-60 min | 87% |
| Refactor | 6-12 hrs | 1-2 hrs | 83% |

### Cost

- **Per issue**: $0.11 - $0.55
- **20 issues/month**: $2 - $11
- **ROI**: 100-200x (API costs vs developer time saved)

## 🔒 Safety Features

Your workflow has multiple safety checkpoints:

1. **Human Plan Approval**: You approve the plan before any code is written
2. **No --yolo Mode**: Gemini asks for confirmation on risky operations
3. **Limited Tools**: Gemini can only use approved file/git operations
4. **CI Tests**: All code must pass tests before merge
5. **Claude Review**: Expert AI review catches issues humans miss
6. **Final Human Merge**: You make the final decision

## 📚 Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `docs/development/AI_WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART.md`
- **Full Guide**: `docs/development/ai-assisted-workflow.md`
- **CLAUDE.md**: Section "AI-Assisted Development Workflow"

## 🧪 Testing the Workflow

### Create a Test Issue

Try it out with a simple test:

```bash
# 1. Create issue on GitHub:
Title: "Add hello world test"
Body: "Add a simple test file that tests a hello() function"

# 2. Add "ai-assist" label

# 3. Wait for Gemini's plan

# 4. Review and approve

# 5. Wait for PR

# 6. Review and merge
```

This will help you understand the workflow before using it for real issues.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Gemini Planning Failed

**Check**:
- Is `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret set correctly?
- Does issue have enough context?
- Check workflow logs for errors

### Gemini Implementation Failed

**Check**:
- Is the plan realistic?
- Does branch already exist?
- Are there merge conflicts?
- Check workflow logs

### Claude Review Missing

**Check**:
- Is `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` still valid?
- Wait a few minutes (Claude may be processing)
- Check claude-code-review.yml logs

### CI Checks Failing

**Fix**:
- Review CI logs for specific errors
- Push fixes to PR branch
- Run `make quick-check` locally first

## 📈 Monitoring

Track these metrics to measure success:

- **Issues processed**: How many used AI-assist
- **Success rate**: % of PRs that merged
- **Time savings**: AI time vs typical manual time
- **Cost**: Gemini API usage
- **Quality**: Bug rate in AI code vs manual

## Summary: What's Different from --yolo Approach

Your suggested workflow had:
```yaml
cli_args: "--yolo"  # ❌ Accepts ALL changes automatically
```

This new workflow has:
```yaml
# ✅ Stage 1: Plan only (read-only, safe)
# ✅ Stage 2: Human approval required before implementation
# ✅ Stage 3: No --yolo (confirms risky operations)
# ✅ Stage 4: Claude reviews all code
# ✅ Stage 5: Human final merge approval
```

**Why this is better**:
- ✅ Human approval before code changes
- ✅ Multiple quality gates (CI, Claude, human)
- ✅ Cost control (plan before expensive implementation)
- ✅ Safety (no accidental destructive operations)
- ✅ Learning (you review plans and understand changes)

**The --yolo approach** would:
- ❌ Execute shell commands without asking
- ❌ Make code changes without review
- ❌ Could create many broken PRs
- ❌ Security risk (arbitrary command execution)
- ❌ Cost explosion (no approval gate)
