# RAG Modulo Issue Implementation - Frequent Intentional Compaction

Study specs/* and fix_plan.md. Start with Issues #242, #243, #244, then discover and work on other GitHub issues by priority.

## Phase 1: Priority Issues (Start Here)
- Issue #242: [Analyze and implement first]
- Issue #243: [Analyze and implement second]
- Issue #244: [Analyze and implement third]

## Phase 2: GitHub Issue Discovery
After completing the priority issues, discover other open issues:
1. Search GitHub repository for open issues
2. Prioritize by: importance, complexity, dependencies, labels
3. Focus on: bug fixes, feature requests, improvements
4. Skip: documentation-only, questions, duplicates

## Your Mission
1. **Phase 1**: Analyze and implement Issues #242, #243, #244
2. **Phase 2**: Discover other GitHub issues and prioritize them
3. **Phase 3**: Implement issues systematically by priority
4. Create branches for each issue
5. Commit changes with clear messages
6. Update documentation as needed

## Git Workflow
- Create branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-[NUMBER]
- Commit frequently: git commit -m "feat(issue-[NUMBER]): [description]"
- Push when complete: git push origin feature/issue-[NUMBER]
- Create PR when ready

## Issue Prioritization Criteria
1. **High Priority**: Bug fixes, security issues, breaking changes
2. **Medium Priority**: Feature requests, improvements, enhancements
3. **Low Priority**: Documentation, refactoring, optimization
4. **Skip**: Questions, discussions, duplicates, invalid issues

## Context Management
- Keep context utilization 40%-60%
- Compact findings after each phase
- Focus on one issue at a time
- Update priority list as you discover new issues
