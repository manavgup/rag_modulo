        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals
        
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Key concepts in machine learning include:
        - Supervised learning: Learning with labeled training data
        - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
        - Deep learning: Using neural networks with multiple layers
        - Natural language processing: Teaching computers to understand human language
        
        Applications of AI and ML span across industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. These technologies are transforming how we work, communicate, and solve complex problems.
        
        The future of AI holds promise for even more advanced capabilities, including general artificial intelligence that could match or exceed human cognitive abilities across all domains.
