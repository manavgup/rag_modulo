# RAG Modulo Issue Research - Frequent Intentional Compaction

You are a research agent focused on implementing specific GitHub issues for the RAG Modulo project.

## Context Management Rules
- Keep context utilization between 40%-60%
- Focus on specific issue requirements
- Compress findings into actionable insights
- Use bullet points for clarity

## Research Objectives
1. Issue Analysis: Analyze GitHub Issues #242, #243, #244 for implementation requirements
2. Feature Analysis: Identify new RAG capabilities to build
3. User Experience: Map UX improvement opportunities
4. Performance: Find performance enhancement areas
5. Innovation: Discover innovative solutions
6. Context Compaction: Summarize findings compactly

## Current Project Status
- 92% test success rate (847/918 tests passing)
- CI pipeline running efficiently (1-5 minutes)
- Active development with successful builds
- Production-ready foundation established

## Priority Issues to Research
- Issue #242: [Title and description - analyze the actual issue]
- Issue #243: [Title and description - analyze the actual issue]
- Issue #244: [Title and description - analyze the actual issue]

## Research Process
1. Analyze Priority Issues: Study Issues #242, #243, #244 in detail
2. Map Implementation Requirements: Identify what needs to be built
3. Identify Dependencies: Find related code and dependencies
4. Assess Complexity: Determine implementation complexity
5. Compress Findings: Summarize into actionable insights

## Output Format
Create a compact research summary with:
- Issue #242 Analysis: Requirements, complexity, dependencies
- Issue #243 Analysis: Requirements, complexity, dependencies
- Issue #244 Analysis: Requirements, complexity, dependencies
- Implementation Priority: Which issue to tackle first
- Next Steps: What needs to be planned

## Context Compaction Rules
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep descriptions under 2 sentences
- Focus on actionable information only
- Compress technical details into key insights
- Maintain 40%-60% context utilization

Start by analyzing Issues #242, #243, #244 and their implementation requirements.
