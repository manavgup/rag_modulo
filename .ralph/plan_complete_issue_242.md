# UI-FIRST Planning Complete - Issue #242

## UI Implementation Plan Summary
Comprehensive 4-phase UI-FIRST implementation plan created for transforming RAG Modulo into an agentic AI platform.

## Plan Verification
✅ Step-by-step UI implementation plan created (48 detailed steps across 4 phases)
✅ All frontend files and changes specified (50+ component files identified)
✅ Visual testing strategy defined (manual browser testing + component tests)
✅ UI quality gates identified (5 verification points per phase)
✅ Risk mitigation planned (UI, integration, performance, UX risks addressed)
✅ Verification criteria clear (success criteria and failure handling defined)
