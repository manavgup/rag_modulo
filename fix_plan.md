# Fix Plan (Feature-First)

## High Priority
- Develop new RAG capabilities (search quality, generation prompts, UX)
- Performance optimizations for retrieval and context assembly

## Medium Priority
- Background: chip away at remaining failing tests (prioritized by impact)

## Notes
- Use Frequent Intentional Compaction (40%-60% context)
- Research -> Plan -> Implement loop per feature
