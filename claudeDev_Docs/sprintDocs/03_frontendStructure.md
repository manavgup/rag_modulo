9. ✅ Error handling and loading states implemented
10. ✅ Form validation and user feedback implemented
11. ✅ Theme system implemented with dark/light mode support
12. ✅ Internationalization support prepared
13. ✅ Performance optimizations implemented
14. ✅ Testing framework set up with React Testing Library

## Steps NOT Completed ❌

1. ❌ **Component Functionality Testing**: Individual components not tested
2. ❌ **User Workflow Testing**: End-to-end user journeys not verified
3. ❌ **API Integration Testing**: Cannot test due to backend auth issues
4. ❌ **Cross-browser Testing**: Browser compatibility not verified

5. **Proceed to Sprint 4** - Core functionality testing

## Notes
- Frontend has solid architecture and comprehensive implementation
- All core UI components are implemented and can be built
- Critical issue: Cannot test API integration due to backend auth problems
- Need to resolve backend issues before testing frontend functionality
- Design system is consistently applied across all components
- Ready for functionality testing once backend issues are resolved
