# Sprint 1: Project Setup ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

## Objectives
- Set up the development environment if it doesn't already exist
- Initialize the project structure, if not already initialized
- Install necessary dependencies, if not already installed
- Configure Docker containers, if not already configured

## Current Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE ⚠️

The project setup has been partially completed with infrastructure running but local development environment having issues.

### Infrastructure Components ✅
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for metadata storage - OPERATIONAL
- **Milvus**: Vector database for embeddings with etcd and MinIO - OPERATIONAL
- **MLFlow**: Model tracking and experiment management - OPERATIONAL
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage - OPERATIONAL
- **Backend Container**: Python 3.12 FastAPI application - OPERATIONAL
- **Frontend Container**: React with IBM Carbon Design - OPERATIONAL
- **Test Container**: Dedicated testing environment - OPERATIONAL

### Container Architecture ✅
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with health checks and volume mounting
- **Frontend**: React application with health checks
- **Test**: Dedicated test environment with full dependency injection
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Milvus, MLFlow, MinIO, etcd

## Steps Completed ✅

1. ✅ Project repository cloned and set up locally
2. ✅ Environment variables configured with comprehensive .env file
3. ✅ Dependencies installed using Poetry with Python 3.12 (in containers)
4. ✅ Docker environment configured with docker-compose
5. ✅ Volume directories created for persistent data storage
6. ✅ Docker images built successfully for all services
7. ✅ All containers running with health checks
8. ✅ Backend API accessible at http://localhost:8000
9. ✅ Frontend application accessible at http://localhost:3000
10. ✅ Infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Milvus, MLFlow) operational

## Issues Identified ❌

1. ❌ **Local Development Environment**: Cannot run backend locally due to missing dependencies
2. ❌ **Dependency Management**: Local Python environment missing required packages (psycopg2, etc.)
3. ❌ **Environment Configuration**: Local environment variables not properly configured
4. ❌ **Testing Framework**: pytest not available in local environment

## Containerization ✅
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI, Poetry dependency management
- **Frontend**: React with IBM Carbon Design, Node.js build process
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13 with health checks and volume persistence
- **Vector Database**: Milvus v2.4.4 with etcd and MinIO integration
- **MLOps**: MLFlow server with PostgreSQL backend and S3 artifact storage

## Completion Checklist ✅
- [x] Project repository cloned and set up locally
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Dependencies installed (in containers)
- [x] Docker images built successfully
- [x] All containers running without errors
- [x] Backend API accessible
- [x] Frontend application accessible
- [x] PostgreSQL database operational
- [x] Milvus vector database operational
- [x] MLFlow tracking server operational
- [x] MinIO object storage operational
- [x] Health checks passing for all services
- [x] Volume mounts configured correctly
- [x] Network configuration established
- [x] Container development environment ready

## Issues to Resolve ❌
- [ ] Local Python environment dependencies installed
- [ ] Local environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Testing framework available locally
- [ ] Local development workflow established

## Current Metrics
- **Backend Code**: 501 Python files
- **Test Coverage**: 136 test files (framework not available)
- **Frontend Code**: 38 JavaScript/TypeScript files
- **API Endpoints**: 50+ RESTful endpoints implemented
- **Database Models**: 9 core models with relationships
- **Vector Database Support**: 5 different vector stores

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Local Development Environment** - Install missing dependencies
2. **Configure Local Testing** - Set up pytest and testing tools
3. **Proceed to Backend Testing** - Verify actual functionality works
4. **Continue with Sprint 2** - Backend implementation review

## Notes
- Infrastructure services are running correctly with proper health checks
- Container development environment is fully operational
- Local development environment needs dependency fixes
- Ready to proceed with functionality testing once local environment is fixed
- Container orchestration is working correctly with dependency management
