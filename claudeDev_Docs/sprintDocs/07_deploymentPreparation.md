# Sprint 7: Deployment Preparation

## Objectives
- Prepare the application for production deployment
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Implement monitoring and logging solutions
- Create backup and disaster recovery plans

## Steps

1. Environment configuration
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure secrets management (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault)
   - Prepare production-ready Docker configurations
     - Update Dockerfile.backend and Dockerfile.frontend for production
     - Create a production-specific docker-compose.yml

2. Database migration and seeding
   - Finalize database schema
   - Create production data migration scripts
   - Prepare initial seed data for production

3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing
     - Set up linting and formatting checks (ruff, black, isort)
     - Configure pytest for backend tests
     - Set up frontend tests using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Set up automated deployment to staging environment
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy for production

4. Production hosting setup
   - Set up production servers or cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
   - Configure load balancers and auto-scaling groups
   - Set up CDN for static assets
   - Configure domain and SSL certificates

5. Monitoring and logging
   - Implement application performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
   - Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk)
   - Create custom dashboards for key metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

6. Backup and disaster recovery
   - Implement automated database backups
   - Create a disaster recovery plan
   - Set up a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Implement data replication for vector databases

7. Security measures
   - Implement SSL/TLS certificates
   - Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Conduct final security audit and penetration testing
   - Implement regular security scans

8. Documentation
   - Create deployment guide
   - Document production environment setup
   - Prepare runbooks for common operational tasks
   - Document rollback procedures

9. Performance testing
   - Conduct final load testing on production-like environment
   - Optimize based on test results
   - Document performance benchmarks

10. Compliance and legal
    - Ensure GDPR compliance (if applicable)
    - Prepare privacy policy and terms of service
    - Conduct final legal review

11. Scalability testing
    - Test auto-scaling capabilities
    - Verify database performance under high load
    - Ensure vector database can handle production-scale data

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Production environment fully configured
- [ ] Database migration and seeding scripts ready
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline set up and tested
- [ ] Production hosting infrastructure prepared
- [ ] Monitoring and logging solutions implemented
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plans in place
- [ ] All necessary security measures implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive deployment documentation created
- [ ] Performance testing completed and optimizations applied
- [ ] All legal and compliance requirements met
- [ ] Scalability verified for production workloads

## Next Steps
With the completion of this sprint, the application should be ready for production deployment. The next steps would involve:
1. Conducting a final review of all systems and documentation
2. Performing a staged rollout to production
3. Closely monitoring the application post-launch
4. Gathering user feedback and planning for future iterations
