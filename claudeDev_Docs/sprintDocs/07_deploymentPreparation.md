## Notes
- **This sprint cannot be completed until previous sprints are tested**
- All deployment preparation work depends on verified working functionality
- Cannot prepare untested system for production deployment
- Need to resolve authentication issues and test core functionality first
- Architecture is solid but implementation needs validation before deployment
- This sprint represents the final deployment phase and cannot be rushed
- Production deployment requires proven, tested functionality
