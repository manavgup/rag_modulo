## Critical Blockers ❌
- **Authentication System**: OIDC authentication not working - blocks all testing
- **Core Functionality**: All RAG features untested
- **Frontend Functionality**: All UI components untested
- **Integration**: Frontend-backend integration untested
- **Data Operations**: All data operations untested

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Authentication System** - Resolve OIDC auth issues (CRITICAL)
2. **Complete Sprint 2** - Test backend functionality
3. **Complete Sprint 3** - Test frontend functionality
4. **Complete Sprint 4** - Test core RAG functionality
5. **Complete Sprint 5** - Test data integration
6. **Then proceed to Sprint 6** - Refinement and polish

## Notes
- **This sprint cannot be completed until previous sprints are tested**
- All refinement and polish work depends on verified working functionality
- Cannot optimize, test, or improve what hasn't been proven to work
- Need to resolve authentication issues and test core functionality first
- Architecture is solid but implementation needs validation before refinement
- This sprint represents the final polish phase and cannot be rushed
