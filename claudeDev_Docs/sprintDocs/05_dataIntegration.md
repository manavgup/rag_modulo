# Sprint 5: Data Integration

## Objectives
- Implement advanced data processing features
- Integrate multiple vector databases
- Develop API for external integrations
- Enhance search capabilities

## Steps

1. Enhance document processing
   - Implement advanced text extraction in document_processor.py
   - Develop image recognition and OCR capabilities
   - Create a pipeline for handling multilingual documents
   - Implement metadata extraction for various file types

2. Integrate multiple vector databases
   - Implement unified interface in vectordbs/vector_store.py
   - Set up connections to:
     - Elasticsearch (elasticsearch_store.py)
     - Milvus (milvus_store.py)
     - Pinecone (pinecone_store.py)
     - Weaviate (weaviate_store.py)
     - ChromaDB (chroma_store.py)
   - Implement data synchronization across databases
   - Create factory.py for easy switching between vector databases

3. Implement custom embedding models
   - Integrate IBM WatsonX for generating embeddings (utils/watsonx.py)
   - Create an interface for plugging in custom embedding models
   - Implement a caching mechanism for embeddings

4. Develop advanced search features
   - Enhance semantic search capabilities in retriever.py
   - Implement filters for metadata-based search refinement
   - Develop a relevance feedback mechanism
   - Implement multi-modal search (text + image)

5. Create API for external integrations
   - Design and document RESTful API endpoints
   - Implement authentication and rate limiting for API access
   - Create SDKs for popular programming languages

6. Implement data export and import features
   - Develop functionality to export search results and document collections
   - Create an import feature for bulk document ingestion
   - Implement data migration tools for moving between vector databases

7. Enhance analytics and reporting
   - Implement advanced usage analytics in AnalyticsDashboard component
   - Create customizable dashboards for different user roles
   - Develop scheduled report generation and distribution

8. Implement A/B testing framework
   - Create a system for testing different search algorithms
   - Implement user feedback collection for search result quality
   - Develop analytics for comparing different configurations
