# Sprint 2: Backend Setup ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

## Objectives
- Implement the backend architecture using FastAPI
- Set up the modular RAG solution
- Implement repository pattern and service layer
- Set up database models and schemas
- Implement API routes

## Current Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE ⚠️

The backend architecture has been implemented with a comprehensive modular RAG solution structure, but core functionality is untested and authentication is broken.

### Architecture Implementation ✅
- **FastAPI Application**: Fully configured with lifespan events, middleware, and comprehensive routing
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented across all 9 core models with full CRUD operations
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in 17 service classes
- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 models with proper relationships and indexing
- **API Routes**: 50+ RESTful endpoints covering all major functionalities

### Critical Issues Identified ❌
- **Authentication System**: All API endpoints return 401 Unauthorized - authentication is broken
- **Functionality Testing**: Core RAG functionality is untested due to auth issues
- **Testing Framework**: pytest is not available for testing
- **API Endpoints**: Cannot verify actual functionality works

## Steps Completed ✅

1. ✅ FastAPI application structure set up with comprehensive configuration
2. ✅ Database models and schemas implemented using Pydantic 2.0
3. ✅ Repository pattern implemented for all models with full CRUD operations
4. ✅ Service layer implemented with comprehensive business logic
5. ✅ Data ingestion pipeline created for various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLSX)
6. ✅ Vector database integration completed with 5 different vector stores
7. ✅ Query rewriting and retrieval mechanisms implemented
8. ✅ API routes created for all main functionalities
9. ✅ Authentication and authorization implemented with OIDC
10. ✅ Error handling and logging set up with custom exceptions
11. ❌ Unit tests written and passing for core functionalities
12. ❌ Integration tests implemented for end-to-end flows

## Steps NOT Completed ❌

1. ❌ **Authentication Testing**: OIDC authentication not working properly
2. ❌ **API Functionality Testing**: Cannot test actual API endpoints due to auth issues
3. ❌ **RAG Pipeline Testing**: Document processing and search functionality untested
4. ❌ **Vector Database Testing**: Vector operations not verified
5. ❌ **Testing Framework**: pytest not available for testing
6. ❌ **Integration Testing**: End-to-end flows not tested

## Issues to Resolve ❌
- [ ] **Fix Authentication System** - Critical blocker for testing
- [ ] **Install Testing Framework** - Need pytest to verify functionality
- [ ] **Test API Endpoints** - Verify actual functionality works
- [ ] **Test RAG Pipeline** - End-to-end document processing and search
- [ ] **Test Vector Database Operations** - Verify search and retrieval
- [ ] **Test User Management** - Verify authentication and authorization
- [ ] **Test Document Processing** - Verify file upload and processing
- [ ] **Test Question Generation** - Verify AI-powered features

## Current Metrics
- **Backend Code**: 501 Python files
- **Test Coverage**: 136 test files (framework not available)
- **API Endpoints**: 50+ RESTful endpoints
- **Database Models**: 9 core models with relationships

## Critical Blockers ❌
- **Authentication System**: OIDC authentication not working - blocks all API testing
- **Testing Framework**: pytest not available - cannot verify functionality
- **API Functionality**: Cannot test actual endpoints due to auth issues
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end flows cannot be verified

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Authentication System** - Resolve OIDC authentication issues
2. **Install Testing Framework** - Set up pytest and testing tools
3. **Test Core Functionality** - Verify RAG pipeline works end-to-end
4. **Test API Endpoints** - Verify all endpoints function correctly
5. **Proceed to Sprint 3** - Frontend structure review

## Notes
- Backend has solid architecture and comprehensive implementation
- All core components are implemented and can be imported
- Critical issue: Authentication system is broken, blocking all testing
- Need to resolve auth issues before proceeding with functionality testing
- Architecture is production-ready, but implementation needs validation
