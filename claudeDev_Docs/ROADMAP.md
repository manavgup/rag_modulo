## Conclusion

The RAG Modulo project has excellent potential with a solid architectural foundation. The main challenge is the **authentication system blocking all testing**, which needs immediate attention. Once this is resolved, the project can progress through systematic testing and validation phases.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Fix authentication system first** - This is the critical blocker
2. **Test systematically** - Don't skip testing phases
3. **Quality over speed** - Ensure functionality works before moving forward
4. **Iterative approach** - Fix issues as they're discovered

With focused effort on the critical path, this project can be completed successfully within the 12-week timeline and deliver a production-ready RAG solution.
