# Design Document Summary

## Project Name: rag_modulo

## Project Type: Web Application

## Project Description
rag_modulo is a robust, customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that supports a wide variety of vector databases, embedding models, and document formats. The solution is designed to be flexible and not dependent on popular RAG frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex, allowing for greater customization and control.

## Key Features
1. Modular Architecture: The project is divided into a backend (business logic) and frontend (user interface), each running in separate Docker containers for improved scalability and maintainability.
2. Multi-Database Support: Integrates with various vector databases, including Elasticsearch, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and ChromaDB.
3. Flexible Document Processing: Handles multiple document formats, including PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and plain text files.
4. Customizable Embedding: Uses IBM's WatsonX for generating embeddings, with the ability to plug in custom embedding models.
5. Efficient Data Ingestion: Robust data ingestion pipeline that processes documents, chunks them appropriately, and stores them in the chosen vector database.
6. Advanced Querying Capabilities: Supports semantic search, query rewriting, and filtering options across stored documents.
7. Scalable Data Storage: Metadata stored in PostgreSQL, while embeddings are stored in the chosen vector database.
8. Repository Pattern: Database operations implemented using the repository pattern with a service layer.
9. RESTful API: Exposes a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and potential integration with other services.
10. Modern Frontend: User interface built using React and IBM Carbon Design.
11. Containerization: Entire solution containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and easy deployment.
12. Configurable: Uses environment variables and configuration files for easy customization.
13. Extensible: Modular design allows for easy addition of new features, document processors, or vector database integrations.
14. Comprehensive Error Handling: Includes custom exception classes and logging for robust error handling and debugging.
15. Testing Suite: Comprehensive set of unit and integration tests.
16. Asynchronous Processing: Utilizes asynchronous programming techniques for improved performance.
