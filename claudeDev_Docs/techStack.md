# Technology Stack

## Frontend
- Framework: React with Create React App
- UI Components: IBM Carbon Design
- State Management: React Context API for local state, React Query for server state
- Routing: React Router
- Testing: Jest and React Testing Library

## Backend
- Server: Python with FastAPI
- Database: 
  - Relational: PostgreSQL
  - Vector Databases: 
    - Milvus
    - Elasticsearch
    - Pinecone
    - Weaviate
    - ChromaDB
- Authentication: JWT, OIDC

## Data Processing
- Document Processing: 
  - PyMuPDF (for PDF)
  - python-docx (for Word documents)
  - openpyxl (for Excel files)
- Embedding: IBM WatsonX

## DevOps and Infrastructure
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI (to be decided)
- Monitoring: To be implemented (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
- Logging: To be implemented (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk)

## Testing
- Backend: pytest
- Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library
- End-to-end: To be implemented (e.g., Cypress)

## Additional Tools
- Code Formatting: Black, isort
- Linting: ruff
- Type Checking: mypy
- API Documentation: FastAPI automatic docs
- Caching: To be implemented (e.g., Redis)
- Internationalization: To be implemented (e.g., react-i18next)

Rationale:
1. React was chosen for the frontend due to its popularity, extensive ecosystem, and compatibility with IBM Carbon Design.
2. FastAPI was selected for the backend because it's modern, fast, and designed for building APIs, which aligns well with our RAG solution requirements.
3. PostgreSQL was chosen as the relational database for its robustness and ability to handle complex queries.
4. Multiple vector databases are supported to provide flexibility and cater to different use cases.
5. Docker is used for containerization to ensure consistency across different environments and ease of deployment.
6. IBM WatsonX was chosen for embeddings due to its customizability and integration with the IBM ecosystem.
7. React Query was selected for server state management due to its powerful caching and synchronization capabilities.
8. JWT and OIDC were chosen for authentication as they provide secure and scalable solutions for token-based and federated authentication.

This technology stack provides a robust, scalable, and flexible foundation for building our RAG solution, allowing for easy customization and extension as needed.
