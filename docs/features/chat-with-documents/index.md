# Chat with Documents - Conversational Interface

Chat with Documents is an advanced conversational interface that enables users to have multi-turn conversations with their document collections, maintaining context across interactions and providing a more natural, interactive experience compared to single-turn Q&A systems.

## Overview

The Chat with Documents system transforms traditional document search into an engaging conversational experience by:

1. **Maintaining conversation sessions** with persistent context and history
2. **Managing context intelligently** with relevance-based pruning and entity extraction
3. **Generating follow-up suggestions** to guide users through deeper exploration
4. **Integrating seamlessly** with existing RAG search capabilities
5. **Providing session management** with archiving, export, and analytics

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from rag_solution.services.conversation_service import ConversationService
from rag_solution.schemas.conversation_schema import ConversationSessionInput, ConversationMessageInput

# Initialize service
conversation_service = ConversationService(db=db, settings=settings)

# Create a new conversation session
session_input = ConversationSessionInput(
    user_id=user_uuid,
    collection_id=collection_uuid,
    session_name="My Chat Session"
)
session = conversation_service.create_session(session_input)

# Add a user message
user_message = ConversationMessageInput(
    session_id=session.id,
    content="What is machine learning?",
    role=MessageRole.USER,
    message_type=MessageType.QUESTION
)
user_response = conversation_service.add_message(user_message)

# Add an assistant response
assistant_message = ConversationMessageInput(
    session_id=session.id,
    content="Machine learning is a subset of AI...",
    role=MessageRole.ASSISTANT,
    message_type=MessageType.ANSWER
)
assistant_response = conversation_service.add_message(assistant_message)
```

### Integration with RAG Search

```python
# In your search service
async def search_with_conversation(search_input: SearchInput, session_id: UUID4):
    # Perform RAG search
    search_result = await self.perform_rag_search(search_input)

    # Add search result to conversation
    message = ConversationMessageInput(
        session_id=session_id,
        content=search_result.answer,
        role=MessageRole.ASSISTANT,
        message_type=MessageType.ANSWER,
        metadata={"sources": search_result.sources}
    )

    return await self.conversation_service.add_message(message)
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Create a new session
curl -X POST "/api/chat/sessions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user-uuid",
    "collection_id": "collection-uuid",
    "session_name": "My Chat Session"
  }'

# Add a message
curl -X POST "/api/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "What is artificial intelligence?",
    "role": "user",
    "message_type": "question"
  }'

# Get conversation history
curl -X GET "/api/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages?user_id={user_id}"
```

## Configuration

Chat with Documents behavior is configurable through environment variables:

```python
# Session configuration
CHAT_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
CHAT_MAX_CONTEXT_WINDOW_SIZE=8000
CHAT_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_SESSION=100

# Context management
CHAT_CONTEXT_PRUNING_THRESHOLD=0.7
CHAT_ENTITY_EXTRACTION_ENABLED=true

# Suggestions
CHAT_SUGGESTION_CACHE_TTL=3600
CHAT_MAX_SUGGESTIONS=5
```

## User Experience

### Conversation Flow

1. **Start Session**: User creates a new conversation session
2. **Ask Questions**: User asks questions about their documents
3. **Get Responses**: System provides AI-generated answers with sources
4. **Follow-up**: User asks follow-up questions naturally
5. **Suggestions**: System offers relevant follow-up questions
6. **Context Management**: System maintains conversation context
7. **Export/Archive**: User can save or export conversations

### Example Conversation

```
User: What is machine learning?
Assistant: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data...

User: Tell me more about it
Assistant: Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning...

User: What are the applications?
Assistant: Machine learning has applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other fields...

[System suggests: "How does deep learning differ from machine learning?", "What are the challenges in ML?"]
```
