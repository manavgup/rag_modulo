## ðŸš€ How It Works

### 1. Voice Upload Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Upload voice sample
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/voices/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "name=My Custom Voice" \
  -F "description=Professional narrator" \
  -F "gender=female" \
  -F "audio_file=@voice_sample.mp3"

# Response:
{
  "voice_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "uploading",  # File stored, ready for processing
  "name": "My Custom Voice",
  ...
}
```

### 2. Voice Processing Workflow (ElevenLabs Cloning)

```bash
# Step 2: Process voice with ElevenLabs
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/voices/{voice_id}/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_name": "elevenlabs"
  }'

# What happens:
# 1. Voice service reads voice sample file
# 2. Creates ElevenLabsAudioProvider instance
# 3. Calls ElevenLabs API: POST /v1/voices/add
# 4. Uploads voice sample for cloning
# 5. Receives provider_voice_id from ElevenLabs
# 6. Updates database:
#    - status: READY
#    - provider_voice_id: <ElevenLabs ID>
#    - provider_name: elevenlabs
#    - quality_score: 85

# Response:
{
  "voice_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "ready",  # Voice cloned and ready to use!
  "provider_voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",  # ElevenLabs voice ID
  "provider_name": "elevenlabs",
  ...
}
```

### 3. Use Custom Voice in Podcast

```bash
# Step 3: Generate podcast with custom voice
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/podcasts/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "collection_id": "col-uuid",
    "duration": 15,
    "host_voice": "custom:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",  # Custom voice
    "expert_voice": "alloy"  # Preset voice
  }'

# What happens:
# 1. Podcast service validates custom voice format
# 2. Resolves custom:UUID to provider_voice_id
# 3. Validates user owns voice and it's READY
# 4. Creates ElevenLabsAudioProvider
# 5. Generates audio using:
#    - HOST: ElevenLabs custom voice (21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM)
#    - EXPERT: OpenAI preset voice (alloy)
# 6. Tracks usage (increments times_used counter)
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Test Voice Upload

```bash
# Get auth token first
JWT_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login ...)

# Upload voice sample
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/voices/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "name=Test Voice" \
  -F "gender=neutral" \
  -F "audio_file=@sample.mp3"

# Expected: 201 Created with voice_id and status=uploading
```

#### 2. Test Voice Processing (ElevenLabs)

```bash
# Process with ElevenLabs
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/voices/{voice_id}/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider_name": "elevenlabs"}'

# Expected: 200 OK with status=ready and provider_voice_id
```

#### 3. Test Custom Voice in Podcast

```bash
# Generate podcast
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/podcasts/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "collection_id": "your-collection-uuid",
    "duration": 5,
    "host_voice": "custom:your-voice-uuid",
    "expert_voice": "onyx"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with podcast queued for generation
```

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all voice tests
poetry run pytest -k "voice" -v

# Expected: 30 tests pass
# - 17 unit tests (voice service)
# - 13 integration tests (workflow)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Provider Selection

The system supports multiple audio providers. You can switch providers by changing configuration:

```bash
# Option 1: Use ElevenLabs for all audio (custom voices only work with ElevenLabs)
PODCAST_AUDIO_PROVIDER=elevenlabs

# Option 2: Use OpenAI for podcasts, ElevenLabs for custom voices (current default)
PODCAST_AUDIO_PROVIDER=openai
# Custom voices automatically use ElevenLabs when voice_id starts with "custom:"

# Option 3: Future - F5-TTS self-hosted (Phase 2)
PODCAST_AUDIO_PROVIDER=f5-tts
```

### How Custom Voices Work with OpenAI Default

Even when `PODCAST_AUDIO_PROVIDER=openai`, custom voices work because:

1. **Voice Resolution** (`podcast_service.py:_resolve_voice`):
   - Detects `custom:` prefix
   - Looks up voice in database
   - Returns `provider_voice_id` from ElevenLabs

2. **Mixed Provider Support**:
   - If both voices are preset â†’ Use OpenAI
   - If any voice is custom â†’ Use ElevenLabs
   - System automatically switches provider per podcast
