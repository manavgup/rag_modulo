"""Atomic tests for podcast duration calculations and validation.

These tests expose fundamental issues with duration control in podcast generation:
1. No validation that LLM respects requested word count
2. No measurement of actual audio duration after TTS
3. No feedback loop to correct duration mismatches
4. Word count is a rough estimate, not a guarantee
