            You are analyzing existing GitHub issues to identify good candidates for AI-assisted implementation.

            **Your Task:**
            1. Get list of open issues (limit to ${{ github.event.inputs.limit || '20' }}):
               ```bash
               gh issue list --state ${{ github.event.inputs.state || 'open' }} \
                 --limit ${{ github.event.inputs.limit || '20' }} \
                 --json number,title,labels,body --jq '.[] | {number, title, labels: [.labels[].name], body}'
               ```

            2. For each issue, assess AI suitability based on:
               - **Good candidates**:
                 * Clear, well-defined problem
                 * Specific bug reports with reproduction steps
                 * Feature requests with detailed requirements
                 * "Good first issue" or "help wanted" labels
                 * Missing tests for existing functionality
                 * Documentation updates
                 * Refactoring with clear scope

               - **Poor candidates**:
                 * Vague descriptions ("something is broken")
                 * Questions or discussions
                 * Security-critical issues
                 * Architecture decisions needed
                 * Already has ai-assist or plan-approved label
                 * Requires domain expertise
                 * Blocked by other issues

            3. Categorize issues into three groups:
               - ✅ **Ready for AI**: Can immediately add ai-assist label
               - ⚠️ **Needs Clarification**: Good candidate but missing details
               - ❌ **Not Suitable**: Should be done manually

            4. Create a summary issue with your analysis:
               ```bash
               gh issue create \
                 --title "🤖 AI-Assist Triage Report - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
                 --label "ai-triage,documentation" \
                 --body "$(cat <<'TRIAGEOF'
               ## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development - Issue Triage Report

               **Analysis Date**: $(date)
               **Issues Analyzed**: ${{ github.event.inputs.limit || '20' }}
               **State**: ${{ github.event.inputs.state || 'open' }}

               ---

               ## ✅ Ready for AI-Assist

               These issues are excellent candidates for automated AI implementation:

               | Issue | Title | Complexity | Why Ready |
               |-------|-------|------------|-----------|
               | #XXX | [title] | Simple | Clear bug with repro steps |
               | #YYY | [title] | Moderate | Well-scoped feature request |

               **Recommended Action**: Add \`ai-assist\` label to these issues.

               ---

               ## ⚠️ Needs Clarification

               These issues could use AI-assist but need more details first:

               | Issue | Title | Missing Info | Suggested Question |
               |-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
               | #AAA | [title] | Reproduction steps | "Can you provide steps to reproduce?" |
               | #BBB | [title] | Expected behavior | "What should happen instead?" |

               **Recommended Action**: Comment on issues to gather details, then add \`ai-assist\`.

               ---

               ## ❌ Not Suitable for AI

               These issues should be implemented manually:

               | Issue | Title | Reason | Recommendation |
               |-------|-------|--------|----------------|
               | #CCC | [title] | Security-critical | Manual implementation with security review |
               | #DDD | [title] | Requires architecture decisions | Design discussion first |

               ---

               ## 📊 Summary Statistics

               - ✅ Ready: X issues (Y%)
               - ⚠️ Needs Clarification: A issues (B%)
               - ❌ Not Suitable: C issues (D%)

               ---

               ## 🎯 Quick Actions

               **To batch-add ai-assist to ready issues:**
               \`\`\`bash
               # Add ai-assist label to recommended issues
               gh issue edit XXX --add-label "ai-assist"
               gh issue edit YYY --add-label "ai-assist"
               # ... etc
               \`\`\`

               **Or use the batch script** (see comment below)

               ---

               *This report was generated by AI Issue Triage workflow.*
               *Review recommendations carefully before applying labels.*
               TRIAGEOF
               )"
               ```

            **Important Guidelines:**
            - Be conservative: When in doubt, mark as "Needs Clarification"
            - Prioritize quality over quantity
            - Consider issue age (older issues may need refresh)
            - Check if issue dependencies are resolved

            To quickly add \`ai-assist\` labels to all recommended issues, create this script:

            \`\`\`bash
            #!/bin/bash
            # batch-ai-assist.sh - Add ai-assist to recommended issues

            # Array of issue numbers from triage report
            # EDIT THIS: Copy issue numbers from 'Ready for AI-Assist' section above
            ISSUES=(
              # XXX  # Short description
              # YYY  # Short description
            )

            echo \"Adding ai-assist label to \${#ISSUES[@]} issues...\"

            for issue in \"\${ISSUES[@]}\"; do
              # Skip comments (lines starting with #)
              [[ \$issue =~ ^# ]] && continue

              echo \"Processing issue #\$issue...\"
              gh issue edit \"\$issue\" --add-label \"ai-assist\"

              # Rate limit: wait 2 seconds between requests
              sleep 2
            done

            echo \"✅ Done! Check issue activity for AI planning results.\"
            \`\`\`

            **Usage:**
            1. Copy the script above to \`batch-ai-assist.sh\`
            2. Edit the ISSUES array with issue numbers from the report
            3. Run: \`chmod +x batch-ai-assist.sh && ./batch-ai-assist.sh\`

            **Monitor Progress:**
            \`\`\`bash
            # Watch for AI planning activity
            gh issue list --label \"ai-assist,plan-ready\" --limit 50

            # See which issues have plans ready for approval
            gh issue list --label \"plan-ready\" --limit 20
