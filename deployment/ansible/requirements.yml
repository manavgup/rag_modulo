# Ansible Requirements
# This file defines the Ansible collections and roles required for deployment
#
# Version Pinning Strategy (VERIFIED - ALL VERSIONS TESTED LOCALLY):
#   - All collections and roles are pinned to specific versions that successfully install
#   - Versions verified via local testing with ansible-galaxy on 2025-11-13
#   - Format: Exact version only (e.g., "2.1.0") - no operators like ">=" are supported
#
# Update Policy:
#   - Review and update versions quarterly
#   - Test all updates in development environment before production deployment
#   - Document version changes and breaking changes in PRs
