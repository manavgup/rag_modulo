    "generated_answer": "Approximately $1 billion per year\n\nExplanation: CIHR's mandate is to excel, according to internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence, in the conduct, creation and translation of knowledge in the health fields. Its mission is to foster health-related research and knowledge translation, to create and disseminate vital new knowledge, to train the next generation of health researchers and to strengthen the Canadian health research community. CIHR is a federal agency that provides funding for health-related research in Canada. It is the largest health research funding agency in Canada, and one of the largest in the world. In 2020, CIHR's budget was approximately $1 billion per year. It funds a wide range of health-related research, including basic biomedical research, clinical research, epidemiology, health services research, and health policy research. It also supports training for health researchers, and provides funding for knowledge translation activities. CIHR is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors, appointed by the federal government. The Board is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the Institute, approving its budget and monitoring its performance. CIHR is funded by the federal government, but it is an independent body that is not subject to direct government control. CIHR has a number of programs and initiatives to support its mission. These include the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Strategic Plan 2019-2024, which outlines the Institute's strategic priorities for the next five years. CIHR also has a number of specific programs and initiatives, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Training Program, which provides funding for health research training in Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Knowledge Translation Initiative, which supports the translation of health research into practice. CIHR also has a number of partnerships and collaborations with other organizations, both in Canada and internationally. These include partnerships with other research funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and collaborations with other organizations, such as the World Health Organization. CIHR is a key player in the Canadian health research landscape. It plays a vital role in supporting health research in Canada, and in promoting the translation of health research into practice. CIHR's budget of approximately $1 billion per year is a significant investment in health research in Canada, and it helps to ensure that Canada remains a leader in health research and innovation.",
